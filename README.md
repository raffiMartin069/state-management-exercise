# Topic: React Native State Management 

This repository is an exercise for students to showcase their understanding of React Native states, including `useState`, `useEffect`, Context API, and state managers like Redux, Recoil, or Zustand.

## Exercise Overview

### Features to Implement:
1. **Theme Switcher**  
   - Switch between dark mode and light mode using the **Context API**.

2. **Counter One**  
   - A counter that increments its value using **useState** and **useEffect**.

3. **Counter Two**  
   - A counter similar to Counter One but implemented using a state manager of your choice (**Redux**, **Recoil**, or **Zustand**).

### Project Structure:
- You can implement these features as:
  - Three separate projects, or
  - A single project containing all three features.
